# Customer-Review-Text-Classifier-Tool
For every retail company which has proper website for placing orders, a logistic network for deliveries, procuring department, there are bound to be several customer issues. The most common source to get aware about these customer issues is customer feedback or customer review which is in the form of text.

Wist uses a software through which it receives the data of feedbacks along with the order number and other relevant details of the order. The most important part of this data is a Net promoter score which is in a range of 0 to 10 and a review text column where the customer writes comments which could be positive or negative.

The crux of the problem is that with the net promoter score we get an idea of how the company is performing over all, but no software is there to process the text in the reviews and extract the exact minute problems faced by the customers. Infact there is no system to categorize the feedback into specific departmental problems so that there is an ease to solve them. The only way to do this is to read each comment word by word and then categorize it manually into one of the categories like delivery issues, website issues, cost issues etc. Some sample instances of the data collected by the software is shown below to show you how it looks like and how it could be addressed.


 



Manual processing is an old school method which takes a lot of time to process thousands of reviews. This method needed to be replaced with a text classification algorithm which can process the review text of customer feedback and then classify it into specific classes. This would create an efficient automated system in which all the review text will be automatically classified into different categories which could be further forwarded to specific departments for necessary action.

Automated Text processing of customer feedback text is a very effective business improvement technique which helps in maintaining customer service at the desired standard. The objective of the solution to this problem will be to increase the average net promoter score of Wist in the market. More the accuracy of the Text Classification Tool, more effective will be rectification of the customer issues and hence more improvement in the business of Wist.
